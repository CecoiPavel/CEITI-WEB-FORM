# Simple CRUD Web Form App in C#

This repository contains a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web form application written in C#. This project is intended to showcase my fundamental knowledge of C# programming and web development. 

## Introduction

This web application is a simple demonstration of CRUD operations using C# as the backend language. It allows users to perform the following actions:

- **Create**: Add new data entries to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display existing data.
- **Update**: Modify and update existing data.
- **Delete**: Remove data entries from the database.

The application is built using C# and it uses a Firebase database to store and manage the data.

## Features
